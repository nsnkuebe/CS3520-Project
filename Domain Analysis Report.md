# **Application Context & Workload Analysis**

**By: IT Visionaries**

## Application Context
The chosen application domain is low-cost AI-enabled mobile phones created for a market in Lesotho. This project addresses the problem of
Africa being primarily a consumer of technology by focusing on the local development of solutions. These phones aim to provide essential 
digital services and improve quality of life through features that are relevant to local realities. These devices could for example, help 
with mobile banking and financial inclusion, providing secure and easy to use services in areas where traditional banking infrastructure 
is limited. In Lesotho examples may include Mpesa and EcoCash.  

However, key user problems include limited network reliability, high data costs, low digital literacy, and the need for secure and 
accessible interfaces. Therefore, by embedding AI capabilities directly on-device, these phones can offer voice interaction in local 
languages, secure biometric authentication for mobile money, and intelligent network management while being low cost devices. This domain 
is highly relevant as it supports Africa’s transition from technology consumers to solution creators, leveraging mobile technology as a 
gateway to financial, political, educational, and social services.

## Representative Applications
| **Application** | **Short Description** | **Key Computational Tasks** | **Notes (Relevence)**|
| :----------- | :------------ | :------------ | ------------ |
| Voice Recognition | Unlock the phone or authenticate the user but recognizing their voice. | Pattern matching, machine learning interference and digital signal processing. | Critical for accessibility and usability in low-literacy contexts. |
| Biometric Security | Uses facial or fingerprint recognition to secure device access and transactions. | Image processing, feature matching, and pattern recognition. | Essential for mobile money security and user authentication. |
| Intelligent Connectivity | AI driven management of network connections to optimize for signal strength, data usage, and battery life. | Sensor data monitoring, rule-based decisions, predictive modelling. | Important for ensuring reliable communication and extending battery life in areas with inconsistent network coverage. |

##  Workload Characteristics 
The identified applications require a mix of integer and floating-point operations, with an emphasis on linear algebra, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning inference. Voice and image processing tasks require moderate to high computational intensity for real-time feature extraction and model inference. Data movement is significant due to continuous sensor input such as audio, image, and network; and memory usage varies from low (Kilobytes for models) to medium (Megabytes for buffering and execution). Latency is critical for user-facing tasks like voice commands and authentication, requiring quick responses. Power consumption must be minimized to suit low-cost mobile devices, favoring efficient, simultaneously computations and avoiding frequent off-chip memory access.

## Initial Insights For Processor Design
- •	Efficient handling of AI workloads: The processor needs specialized instructions or hardware to accelerate machine learning inference and signal processing, reducing the time and energy spent on these tasks.
- •	Optimized Memory Hierarchy: A well-designed memory hierarchy with low-latency access is crucial to efficiently handle the large amount of data required for tasks like image and voice recognition.
- •	Power Management: The processor's design must prioritize energy efficiency to extend battery life, a key feature for a low-cost mobile device.
- •	Scalability: The design should be scalable to accommodate future AI applications and evolving workload demands without a complete hardware overhaul.
